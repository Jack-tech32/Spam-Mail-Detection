# ðŸ“§ Spam Email Detection 

Interactive Application Link ::   https://spam-mail-detection-w2xojn5ida5a6awclkj869.streamlit.app/


This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that detects whether a given message is **spam or not** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a trained classification model. 
Built with Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit, it's designed to be simple, clean, and interactive.

 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a web-based application that:
- Accepts any text input (like an email or SMS)
- Processes and analyzes the text using TF-IDF
- Predicts whether the message is spam or ham using a trained model
- Displays the result instantly via a Streamlit UI

 Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Total Samples**: 5,572 messages
- **Columns**:
  - "v1": Label ("ham" or "spam")
  - "v2": Message content (text)

After preprocessing, we used:

- "message": cleaned and lowercased
- "label_num": numeric version of "ham" (0) and "spam" (1)

 Machine Learning Flow

1. Text cleaning (lowercase, remove punctuation/numbers)
2. Vectorization using "TfidfVectorizer"
3. Train/Test Split (80/20)
4. Model: "MultinomialNB"
5. Evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
6. Model + Vectorizer saved using "joblib"
